# QrMaps
My dissertation project. Essentially a data mapping joint service which would allow a predefined client and 
affiliated users to see personal multimedia clips retrieved from a database and mapped out onto web interface markers. 

The system has been developed for 7 groups who were part of the performing arts course in Bucks New University. 
Each group has been assigned an email and password for the login page. 
To bypass the login system an view the project live, please use the following details:
