# QrMaps
My dissertation project. Essentially a data mapping joint service which would allow a predefined client and affiliated users to see personal multimedia clips retrieved from a database and mapped out onto web 
interface markers. 

The system has been developed in two sections. The QR code aspect of the system allows users to retrieve the mapped media through the use of QR codes. This data is manually stored in a database via latitude and longitude. The second part of the system is based on locations on a map. The locations of each QR code are manually placed on the map.

The system has been developed for 7 groups who were part of the performing arts course in Bucks New University. 
Each group has been assigned an email and password for the login page. 
To bypass the login system an view the project live, please use the following details:
